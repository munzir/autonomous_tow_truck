// Input: Pin D5
// Note from Shaheer: I do not understand a good portion of this code,
// especially the work with interrupts, since I borrowed this from online to
// save time and effort. Perhaps I will set aside some time to understand and
// explain this, but for now, consider this as a black box that takes a typical
// digital signal (where 0-1 V is low and 4-5 V is high) and figures out its
// frequency. The larger the sampling time, the more accurate our frequency...
// but the less frequently we will be updated. This is not to say that low
// sampling time kills the accuracy, just that we will have to consider the
// average of the output data (for example, we are sending 50 Hz and the output
// constantly alternates between 0 and 100 Hz equally, averaging to 50 Hz).
// Trial and error is a good idea to find the sweet spot.
